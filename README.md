==========

This work is an implementation of an autonomous wheeled robot which is able to drive through a white lane into a black background. An Android app provides access to the camera of a smartphone, which acts as the robot’s only sensor. The control system is realized synthesizing a neural network in a supervised manner (backpropagation) based on actions previously executed by the user (the user drives the robot with a joystick while the java application builds the data set). The electronic components of the robot are managed by the software written in the Arduino’s sketch.
